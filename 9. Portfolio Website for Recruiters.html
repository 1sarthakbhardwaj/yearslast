<p>First, we have created a group for students of this course to network on LinkedIn with each other: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12121940" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12121940</a><br><br>Second, I have a lot of recruiters contacting me for remote work developers lately. In order to connect students who are looking for jobs with these recruiters, I have created a simple website where you can list your information and your portfolio. This way, I can just forward these requests to this page for recruiters to check you out. This is completely optional and I hope some students will be able to get jobs this way. <br><br>You can check out the website here: <a href="https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/ZtM-Job-Board/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/ZtM-Job-Board</a><br><br>By the way, this is a project that is open sourced, and can be improved upon by the community.<br><br>To learn how to add your name to the list: <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ZtM-Job-Board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ZtM-Job-Board</a></p>
